## What Hone Runs

Hone is a multi-process local assistant stack:

- `hone-console-page`: local Web backend and static asset server.
- `hone-cli`: local command-line entrypoint for doctor, onboarding, config, chat, and runtime start.
- `hone-mcp`: local MCP server used by ACP runners to expose Hone tools.
- `hone-desktop`: Tauri desktop host.
- `hone-imessage`, `hone-discord`, `hone-feishu`, `hone-telegram`: optional channel listeners.
- `packages/app`: SolidJS Web UI for admin console, public chat, memory, settings, and runtime views.
- `skills/`: built-in skill prompts and optional script-backed skill entrypoints.
- `memory/`: local persistence for sessions, cron jobs, portfolios, quotas, company profiles, and audit logs.

At runtime, user messages enter through Web, desktop, or an IM channel. The channel builds a normalized request, `hone-channels` selects and runs the configured agent runner, `hone-tools` exposes tools and skills, `memory` persists state, and the final response is rendered back to the source channel.

## Prerequisites

Recommended local environment:

- macOS or Ubuntu.
- Rust toolchain and Cargo.
- Bun for frontend and Tauri dev/build flows.
- Git.
- Optional: Homebrew for macOS/Linux package install.
- Optional: `gh` for GitHub issue/PR workflows.
- Optional runners: Codex CLI/ACP or OpenCode ACP.

For source checkout development:

```bash
rustup update
bun install
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

If `config.yaml` already exists, keep it. It is the canonical local config and may contain credentials or machine-specific settings.

## Install And Start From Release

Use this path when you want to run Hone without cloning the repository.

### One-line install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw/main/scripts/install_hone_cli.sh | bash
hone-cli doctor
hone-cli onboard
hone-cli start
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw/honeclaw
hone-cli doctor
hone-cli onboard
hone-cli start
```

`hone-cli onboard` guides runner selection, optional channel setup, and provider/API-key setup. `hone-cli start` starts the local backend plus enabled channel listeners in the foreground.

See the detailed runbook: [`docs/runbooks/hone-cli-install-and-start.md`](./runbooks/hone-cli-install-and-start.md).

## Start From Source

Clone and prepare:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw.git
cd honeclaw
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
bun install
```

Start backend and enabled channel listeners only:

```bash
./launch.sh
```

Start backend, enabled channels, and both admin/public Vite frontends:

```bash
./launch.sh --web
```

Start desktop development mode where the desktop owns bundled backend/channel sidecars:

```bash
./launch.sh --desktop
```

Start backend/channels outside the desktop host, then launch desktop in remote mode:

```bash
./launch.sh --desktop --remote
```

Start release desktop mode without Tauri dev hot reload:

```bash
./launch.sh --release
```

Stop launcher-managed processes:

```bash
./launch.sh stop
```

## Desktop Startup Modes

Use the mode that matches what you are testing:

| Command | Best For | What It Starts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `./launch.sh --desktop` | Bundled desktop integration checks. | Vite + Tauri dev; desktop starts embedded backend and enabled channels. |
| `./launch.sh --desktop --remote` | Daily desktop UI work while keeping backend/channels stable. | Backend + channels + Vite + Tauri dev connected to remote backend config. |
| `./launch.sh --release` | Long-running desktop verification without Rust hot reload. | Builds release desktop assets and runs the release desktop binary. |

For daily development, prefer `--desktop --remote` when backend/channel processes should not restart on every desktop shell rebuild. Use `--desktop` when validating bundled sidecar startup, process locks, and desktop-managed runtime behavior.

## Web Startup Modes

| Command | Best For |
| --- | --- |
| `./launch.sh` | Runtime-only backend/channel smoke. |
| `./launch.sh --web` | Browser UI development against local backend/channels. |
| `bun run dev:web` | Frontend-only admin UI work when backend is already running. |
| `bun run dev:web:public` | Frontend-only public chat UI work when public backend is already running. |
| `bun run build:web` | Build admin Web assets. |
| `bun run build:web:public` | Build public Web assets. |
| `bun run build:web:desktop` | Build desktop Web assets with relative asset paths. |

`./launch.sh --web` starts both the admin and public Vite servers after the backend is ready.

## Configuration

Source checkout config:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

Installed config:

```bash
hone-cli config file
```

Useful CLI config commands:

```bash
hone-cli doctor
hone-cli onboard
hone-cli configure --section agent --section channels --section providers
hone-cli config get agent.runner
hone-cli config set agent.runner opencode_acp
hone-cli models set --runner opencode_acp --model openrouter/openai/gpt-5.4 --variant medium
```

Important config areas:

- `agent.*`: runner choice, model routing, timeout behavior.
- `llm.*`: provider keys and OpenAI-compatible/OpenRouter routes.
- `channels.*`: Feishu, Discord, Telegram, and iMessage enablement and credentials.
- `web.*`: admin/public ports and host behavior.
- `storage.*`: JSON/SQLite session backend and data paths.
- `scheduler.*`: scheduled task and heartbeat behavior.
- `event_engine.*`: market/news event monitoring and delivery.
- `search.*`, `fmp.*`: external data/search providers.

Never commit local secrets in `config.yaml`.

## Model And Runner Setup

Hone can use local CLI/ACP runners or OpenAI-compatible cloud APIs.

For the built-in `function_calling` runner, the primary OpenAI-compatible route
comes from `llm.provider=openai` (or `openai-compatible`) together with
`llm.api_base`, `llm.api_key`, and `llm.model`. This is the path to use for
local Ollama-style endpoints.

Common runner choices:

| Runner | Use When |
| --- | --- |
| `opencode_acp` | You want Hone to inherit local OpenCode provider/model config. |
| `codex_acp` | You use Codex ACP and want ACP session integration. |
| `codex_cli` | You use Codex CLI directly. |
| `function_calling` | You want the built-in OpenAI-compatible function-calling path. |
| `multi-agent` | You want separate search and answer stages. |

Typical OpenCode setup:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
hone-cli config set agent.runner opencode_acp
hone-cli start
```

Typical model override:

```bash
hone-cli models set --runner opencode_acp --model openrouter/openai/gpt-5.4 --variant medium
```

If using cloud APIs, configure keys through `hone-cli onboard`, `hone-cli configure`, or direct config edits.

## Channel Setup

Channels are optional. Enable only the ones you actually use.

```bash
hone-cli channels list
hone-cli channels set telegram --enabled true --bot-token "<token>"
hone-cli channels set discord --enabled true --bot-token "<token>"
```

For Feishu/Lark, Discord, Telegram, and iMessage, check `config.example.yaml` for required fields and comments. The onboarding wizard also prints prerequisite notes when enabling channels.

Channel reminders:

- iMessage is macOS-only and depends on local permissions.
- Feishu/Lark requires tenant app credentials and target resolution.
- Discord and Telegram require bot tokens and correct bot/channel permissions.
- Group chat behavior depends on channel `chat_scope` and explicit trigger rules.

## Common URLs And Ports

Defaults in source checkout:

| Service | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Admin backend/API | `http://127.0.0.1:8077` |
| Public backend/API | `http://127.0.0.1:8088` |
| Admin Vite frontend | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` |
| Public Vite frontend | `http://127.0.0.1:3001` |
| Health/meta check | `http://127.0.0.1:8077/api/meta` |

Override ports with environment variables:

```bash
HONE_WEB_PORT=8078 HONE_PUBLIC_WEB_PORT=8089 ./launch.sh --web
```

## Stop, Restart, And Cleanup

Stop processes started by `launch.sh`:

```bash
./launch.sh stop
```

Stop a foreground `hone-cli start`:

```bash
Ctrl-C
```

Clean installed Hone runtime data:

```bash
hone-cli cleanup
```

Non-interactive full cleanup:

```bash
hone-cli cleanup --all --yes
```

Homebrew package removal:

```bash
brew uninstall honeclaw
```

## Verification Commands

General checks:

```bash
hone-cli doctor
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8077/api/meta
```

Rust checks:

```bash
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --exclude hone-desktop
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --exclude hone-desktop
```

Frontend checks:

```bash
bun run typecheck:web
bun run test:web
```

CI-safe regression scripts:

```bash
bash tests/regression/run_ci.sh
```

Desktop crate type check without bundled resource validation:

```bash
HONE_SKIP_BUNDLED_RESOURCE_CHECK=1 cargo check -p hone-desktop
```

Manual regression scripts live in `tests/regression/manual/` and may require external accounts or local machine state.

## Troubleshooting

### `hone-cli` not found

```bash
command -v hone-cli || ls -l ~/.local/bin/hone-cli
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### `./launch.sh` says `config.yaml` is missing

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

Then edit `config.yaml` or run CLI configuration commands.

### Bun is missing

Install Bun and rerun:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
exec "$SHELL" -l
bun install
```

### Port already occupied

Try the managed stop first:

```bash
./launch.sh stop
```

If a process is still holding a port, inspect it:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:8077 -sTCP:LISTEN
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

### Backend starts but Web assets are missing

For source checkout:

```bash
bun run build:web
bun run build:web:public
```

For installed release, reinstall the latest bundle and confirm:

```bash
ls ~/.honeclaw/current/share/honeclaw/web/index.html
```

### A channel exits during startup

Check config and logs:

```bash
tail -200 data/runtime/logs/*.log
hone-cli channels list
```

A disabled channel may exit intentionally with the configured skip path. Missing credentials, invalid tokens, lock conflicts, or port conflicts are the usual real failures.

### Desktop opens but shows a blank page

For source desktop release mode, rebuild desktop Web assets with the desktop-specific asset base:

```bash
bun run build:web:desktop
./launch.sh --release
```

For desktop dev, prefer:

```bash
./launch.sh --desktop --remote
```
